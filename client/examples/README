This directory contains example programs which use the removinator module.
These examples expect that you have the removinator module installed already.

In addition, you will need to ensure that your user has permission to use the
serial port to interface with the Removinator controller device.  On many Linux
systems, this can be achieved by adding your user to the 'dialout' local group.
If you add your user to this group, you will need to re-login for the
group membership to take effect.

Some of these examples may require additional Python modules or utilities.  It
is recommended that you first look at the example code to see what it requires
before attempting to run it.
